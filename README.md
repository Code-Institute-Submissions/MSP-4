## About

 **TastyThings** web application is related to restaurant based recipe site where  users can add ,edit ,delete , access cooking recipes and book a table .

#### Goal

A full stack CRUD application that allows users to register and log in to create, edit, update and delete recipes.

This application uses Python on the back-end with the Flask web framework, and uses MongoDB for the database. It also uses the Materialize framework on the front-end.

Built for Milestone Project no.3 in the Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute, in the Data Centric Development module.

The core focus of this project is on functional app logic created with **Python** while utilising the **Flask** framework and **MongoDB** NoSQL database.
# Strategy Plane
The overall aim of the project is to create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. The logic of the app will be written using a variety of technologies but predominantly using the Python Flask micro framework, jQuery and MongoDB.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to enhance the look and feel of the application. 
## Project Charter 
||Objectives |
|:---|:---|
|**Purpose:** What purpose does the website serve?|The web application allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes|
|**Goals:** What outcomes does it need to achieve?|<ul><li>allow users to store and easily access cooking recipes </li><li>editing and </li><li>deleting of recipes</li><li>group and summarise the recipes</li></ul>
|**Target audience:** Whom must the product appeal to and work for?|<ul><li>Casual cooks just browsing for an easy recipe </li><li>Cooking hobbyists</li><li>Professional and semi-professional cooks</li></ul>|
|**Success indicators:** How will you know you have achieved project goals?|A steady increase in the number of recipes added by users would be a clear indication of the success of the application|
|**Strategies:** What approaches will help to realise the goals?|<ul><li>We will take a mobile first approach to Content</li><li>Provide useful, interesting and focused content for our target audience</li><li>Aim to keep the site simple and not over complicated</li><li>Present content in a clear and user-friendly way</li></ul>
|**Tactics:** What activities might help to realise the strategies?|<ul><li>Provide useful and relevant content to users</li><li>Provide a user experience that is accessible and enjoyable for all visitors</li><ul><li>following conventions for design and interaction</li><li>providing clear and consistent navigation</li></ul></ul>

## Defensive Design
Defensive design for TastyThings application will focus on the most common points of failure: user input areas, feedback and server problems.
*	I will employ form validation to check for user 
*	I will protect users from server errors and broken links with informative messages
*	My Defensive design will assist the user before mistakes happen.

The user will be informed if that username has already been taken and asked to enter a different username. The form will have validation and offer clear instructions to users on how to proceed.
Environmental variables have been used to protect access details to the database.
Development was done using a local database, and the Heroku hosted app connects to an mLab database. Heroku environmental variables hide the database name, the username and password.

## UX
 
This application was built to allow users create and share recipes, as well as updating and deleting them as necessary. The application provides a registration page for new users to register on the site, a log in page to sign in after they have registered and a contact page where users can book a table.
As a user I can:
- register as a user on the site
- log in to the site once registered
- add new recipes to the site (when logged in)
- user with same user and author name can view features of edit and delete in recipes page.(when logged in)
- edit recipes I create on the site (when logged in)
- delete any recipes I created on the site (when logged in)
- view a list of recipes stored on the site
- click on a recipe to see information about the recipe
- read the method for preparing the recipe
- book a table in our restaurant and can plan a visit .


#### Layout Pro 

- Choosing a **multiple page application (MPA)** takes into consideration the choice to make new content and spot it on new pages. Multi-page applications can incorporate as much data as required.
#### Layout Con 

- Being as this is a multi-page application, a server needs to reload most assets, for example, HTML, CSS, and **Python** with each interaction. When loading another page, the browser completely reloads page information and downloads all assets once more, even rehashed segments throughout all pages (for example the header/navigation) which influences Speed and Execution.

#### Template Style

- I opted for the business -casual  framework. As a tool, Bootstrap is excellent to get started, but I feel it cannot create a real quality UI without the need to write a considerable amount of custom CSS to get anywhere close to the look.

#### Navigation

- A navigation bar takes up space and wasn't fixed to top  because of site designing as the title of the site should come first ,so for easy navigation users can use bottom to top icon . That being the case, and that there is a lot of content to display in the form of recipes, etc., 
The navbar will be available to users at the top of the application on every page.
Unregistered users will see links to Sign In,contact and Recipes
Registered users will see links to Sign Out, Recipes, Add Recipe and Recipes.

### Database structure
- I separated my users from the recipes to create two separate entities.
As a recipe document is created in the recipes collection, the author of the recipe (the user who was logged in) is recorded against the recipe under the author field(STR).
**Sample Recipe doc**
```
{"_id":{"$oid":"5efe36b8c56aa8e45ef15430"},
"recipe_name":"Fudgy chocolate brownies",
"author":" Usha",
"recipe_intro":"These lower-fat brownies taste totally lush and are worth every calorie! ",
"ingredients":"400g tin black beans, drained and rinsed (235g/8½oz drained weight)80g/3oz light vegetable oil spread,4 large free-range eggs60g/2¼oz good-quality cocoa powder, plus 1 tsp for dusting50g/1¾oz ground almonds1 tbsp vanilla extract2½ tbsp maple syrup1 tsp instant coffee granules4 tbsp granulated sweetener60g/2¼oz dark chocolate chips",
"description":"Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line a 20cm/8in square baking tin with baking paper.Put the black beans and vegetable spread into a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the eggs and blend again briefly, until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.Add the cocoa powder, ground almonds, vanilla extract, maple syrup, coffee granules, sweetener and half of the chocolate chips. Whisk to combine evenly.Pour the mixture into the lined tin and sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips over the surface. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 18–20 minutes, or until just firm to the touch.Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly before carefully lifting the brownie out of the tin and cutting it into squares. Enjoy while still warm, sprinkled with a little sifted cocoa.","preparation_time":"20 mins",
